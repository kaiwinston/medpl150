<h1>Kai's MEDPL 150 Portfolio</h1>
<p>My name is Kai and I’m a student and server based in Manhattan, NY (as of three days ago). I bounced around a bit as a kid--I was raised in Brooklyn, by virtue of memories, found my way back to the city 9 years after leaving it. I’m interested in journalism, documentaries, and the stories people have to tell. I’ve lived all over the West Coast, the tristate area, and briefly Middle America. If there’s one thing I took away from it, it’s the importance of perspective and empathy.

 I enjoy what’s misunderstood. I want to work as a bridge-- giving others a platform to speak their part; to cover what was overlooked. I like the truth, I think it’s important. I strive to find it through print, video, and perhaps photography if I see fit. I want to make others feel-- that’s what good journalism is; writing in general, painting, sculpting, all mediums I think.

Ironically, I’m not a big bookworm, though my passion does stem from three books in particular: Slouching Towards Bethlehem (Joan Didion, 1968), A Dirty War (Anna Politkovskaya, 2001), and Behind the Beautiful Forevers (Katherine Boo, 2012). Recently, I’ve also been enjoying Andrew Callaghan’s trending Channel 5. Curiosity is key, so is transparency. Relevance is subjective, and independence is of the utmost importance.

In the coming weeks, I’d love to crash course videography. I have a very novice-level understanding of camera equipment, editing software, etc, and would love to dive into that. Photography is definitely of interest as well--it feels like a separate realm. I want to do what feels right. It’s usually what produces the best work, and it makes me happy.
